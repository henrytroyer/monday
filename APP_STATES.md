# Understanding App States: Development vs Live

## Two Ways to Use Your App

### 1. Development Mode (What We're Doing Now) ✅

**You DON'T need the app to be "live" or published!**

For development, you use:
- **Custom URL** (your ngrok URL)
- App runs on your local computer
- Only you can see it (in your monday.com account)
- Perfect for testing and development

**How it works:**
1. App exists in Developer Center (but not published)
2. You set Custom URL to your ngrok URL
3. You can use it in your own monday.com account
4. Changes update instantly (hot reload)

**This is what we've been setting up!**

### 2. Published/Live Mode (For Later)

**When you're ready to share with others:**
- Deploy app to monday.com hosting
- Submit for review (if making it public)
- Others can install and use it
- No Custom URL needed

**You don't need this for development!**

## Your Current Setup

Based on what we've done:

✅ **App Created** in Developer Center (ID: 10499615)
✅ **Feature Added** (Board View or Dashboard Widget)
✅ **Custom URL Set** (your ngrok URL)
✅ **Dev Server Running** (localhost:4040)
✅ **Tunnel Active** (ngrok forwarding)

**This means your app IS ready to use in development mode!**

## Using Your Development App

Even though it's not "published" or "live", you can use it:

1. **In Developer Center:**
   - Your app exists
   - It's in "development" or "testing" state
   - That's fine!

2. **In monday.com:**
   - Go to your board/dashboard
   - Your custom view/widget should be available
   - It loads from your ngrok URL (local development)

3. **Only You Can See It:**
   - Since it's not published, only YOUR account can use it
   - That's perfect for development!

## When Do You Need "Live"?

You only need to publish/deploy when:
- ✅ You want to share with your team
- ✅ You want to make it public
- ✅ You're ready for production use
- ✅ You want others to install it

**For now, development mode is perfect!**

## Checking Your App Status

1. Go to Developer Center: https://developer.monday.com/apps
2. Click your app
3. Look at the status:
   - **"Development"** or **"Testing"** = Perfect! Use Custom URL
   - **"Published"** = Live and available to others
   - **"Pending Review"** = Submitted but not approved yet

## What "Not Live" Means

**"Not live" typically means:**
- App isn't published to the marketplace
- Others can't install it
- But YOU can still use it for development!

**This is exactly what you want for now!**

## Summary

**Your app doesn't need to be "live" to:**
- ✅ Develop and test locally
- ✅ Use Custom URL with ngrok
- ✅ See it in your monday.com account
- ✅ Make changes and see them instantly

**You only need "live" to:**
- Share with others
- Make it public
- Put it in production

**For development, "not live" is perfect!**
